## Purpose 
I believe that at this stage of my career, my personal side should no longer be for a strictly professional audience. 

> I think my personal site doesn't need to be for a professional audience anymore. I want it to be for potential friends, mentors, mentees, neighbors, etc; anyone that wants an introduction to me.

Therefore, the purpose of the site is to act as an introduction to me and thereby create connection on my behalf. Anyone that comes to my site should feel engaged to connect.

## Brand 
I have centered my primary brand trait around connection. Whether at work or with friends, my ability to connect, stay connected, and facilitate new connections is where I bring high impact.

Both my professional and personal relationships benefit from this quality, so it's a great choice for a website meant for anyone. 

## Development
Created in Svelte. 
With Sass. 
And @arjunanimations.

## Design 
High in warmth (colours, copy). 
High in engagement (animations, copy, graphics).
